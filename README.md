Welcome to the RC Car ESP Control project! This repository contains the code for controlling your RC car using an ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller.

## Features

- **Wireless Control**: Control your RC car remotely using a custom controller or smartphone app.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Receive live data feedback, including speed, battery status, and more.
- **Easy Customization**: Modify the code to fit different RC car models and adjust control logic.
- **Web Interface**: Access a user-friendly web interface to configure settings and monitor the car.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller
- Motor driver module compatible with your RC car
- RC car chassis with motors and wheels
- Power source (battery pack) for the RC car
- Smartphone or computer for remote control

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Basem0/Esp-Rc-Car/]
    ```

2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

3. Configure the necessary settings in the `config.h` file.

4. Upload the code to your ESP microcontroller.

5. Connect the ESP to the motor driver and other components according to the wiring instructions in the documentation.

6. Power up your RC car and start controlling it remotely!
